With a solid foundation in programming, data science, marketing, and startup building, I am now enhancing my Python Web Development skills. Driven by a passion for learning, I seek opportunities that will enable me to develop tools that prioritize societal impact over profit. Current Learning Adventure I'm going all in on python web development, and here is where I've gotten so far: Diving deeper into Django for the back-end, enjoying things like: AJAX with htmx and django-template-partials for cleaner templates. Complex queries with Django's Q Real-time search Advanced form handling with e.g. formset factories User authentication with django-allauth Email verification and notifications ... On the front-end, I've designed with Figma and Webflow, and make pages interactive using HTMX, Hyperscript, and some vanilla JS. Deployed on Digital Ocean and Render.com with Cloudinary for media management. Documenting my learnings along the way with obsidian.md Sketching out a roadmap to pinpoint what I want to learn next, ensuring I keep pushing my skills forward.

Achievements Mini-portfolio pages for each of these achievements will follow: Humainly Project Employed 30'ish people across Venezuela and Nigeria with collaborations with local NGO's to provide those employees with infrastructure and training so they could build out their careers. Meshmonk A medical image processing framework developed in C++ for computational efficiency, this framework is used by dozens of researchers mostly working on medical craniofacial data. Below you can see an animation of what it does (transform one surface into another). There are 148 results on scholar.google.com of articles that have used or mentioned MeshMonk ( link ). Insert GIF here Paid Ads Optimization Framework Developed an advanced paid ads optimization framework, which I'll publish later for others to take inspiration from. This was a big contribution in turning around the sales numbers at the startup I was working at during the energy crisis of Q4 2022. Marketing Data ELT Pipeline Without any prior experience with databases and/or SQL, I developed an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipeline for all the marketing data an moonbird. This contributed to our organization being as data-driven as it was. Tools I used were mostly Stitch Data, Dataform and Looker Studio. Server-Side Web Tracking Web & Server GTM Drawn to the technical aspect of marketing, I figured I wanted to learn how user tracking works. So autodidactically I figured out how to set up a state-of-the-art tracking system including server-side tagging with Server Google Tag Manager (GTM). Experience Professional Moonbird (Belgium) Growth Engineer, Oct 2020 - May 2024 --- The What --- I'm a technically creative numbers guy. I design and implement experiments to grow moonbird's B2C traction, and let the data teach us what we should do next. With my engineering and startup entrepreneurship background, I'm proactive, analytical and methodical, and take the fluff out of Growth Hacking to make it uncool but effective. --- The Why --- As someone who knows insomnia first-hand and tried everything, I know moonbird can help people achieve their desired state of mind. There is a way. But don't take my word for it. I'll do what I can to find everyone that needed help like I did, and offer them a real solution. No more dubious fixes that are - at best - ineffective and make people lose hope.--- Humainly (Belgium - Venezuela - Nigeria) Co-Founder & CEO, May 2018 - March 2020 I traveled to South America for 1 year. I ended up in Venezuela and felt I could help people there by creating a digital bridge, creating online work for locals. That idea evolved into my startup Humainly ( https://humainly.com/ ), where I was co-founder and CEO. We\u2019d sell digital image labelling services to companies in Belgium. This would create digital jobs that we\u2019d offer to people with little opportunity in Nigeria. Simultaneously, we worked together with Nigerian NGO\u2019s to offer education to those workers. That way they\u2019d have an income while acquiring new skills that could get them on a sustainable career path (outside of our non-profit startup). Launched Humainly after providing image annotation to clients of our consulting business WebMonks. Humainly combines the best of both worlds in image annotation: - Fully dedicated service to clients to help them obtain training data effortlessly - Impact sourcing talented people in low-income areas of the world to generate social impact in local communities. WebMonks (Belgium) Co-Founder & CEO, Oct 2015 - March 2020 * Consulting businesses on Computer Vision and Machine Learning problems * I've done consulting for international companies on topics ranging from regular machine learning (data science) to deep learning solutions for computer vision problems, to developing CGI pipelines for synthetic image generation. * I'm experienced in both project management and recruiting and onboarding new consultants in virtual teams using agile approaches. * I've worked on two open-source projects (MeshMonk and MONK3D) * I know my way around business development, product management, project management, recruiting, organizational structures, marketing etcetera. All fields required to build both service- and product-oriented businesses from scratch. MIRC -- Medical Imaging Research Center (Belgium) Research position, 2012-2014 (24 months): I worked for two years as a researcher for the KU Leuven at the medical imaging research center which is located in the university hospital UZ Leuven. My focus was the development of medical image processing algorithms for automated diagnosis and quantification of structural pathologies in patients. Achievement: Developed an efficient modular surface registration framework capable of processing large surfaces (> 100,000 points) in an efficient way (< 200 seconds). Achievement: Developed a method for patient-specific maxillofacial prosthesis design. Achievement: Developed a tool for processing and analyzing 3D surface scans (including shape and texture). Rebus vzw (Belgium) Tutor , 2009-2010 (4 months) My summer jobs in between the academic years as a university student consisted of tutoring. The subjects listed were all at the university level: Mathematical Analysis (Applied) Statistics Electronics and Information Technology Mechanics MTEC -- National Metal and Materials Technology Center (Thailand) Internship , 2011 (two months) One of my most life-changing experiences was my two-month internship at the MTEC in Thailand. A first part was spent in the Sangklanagarind hospital of southern Thailand to identify their needs, the second part in the MTEC center near Bangkok to find a solution. Achievement: Developed a tool to model patient femurs used for implant design.
