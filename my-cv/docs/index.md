## Summary
I'm co-founder and head of technology in WebMonks, an organization dedicated to advancing the state-of-the-art of Artificial Intelligence. Next to consulting in Deep Learning for Computer Vision challenges, we work on an open-source framework called MONK3D which allows computers to synthesize 3D representations of objects in 2D images. This breakthrough would allow advances for many computer vision challenges.

I have expertise in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Computer Generated Imagery (CGI). In previous work, I've always performed applied research in these or related fields.

My ambition is to build a career in a setting where helping people stands central, potentially through an enabler such as AI technology.

## Experience

#### WebMonks Consulting (Belgium)
* I've done consulting for international companies on topics ranging from regular machine learning (data science) to deep learning solutions for computer vision problems, to developing CGI pipelines for synthetic image generation.
* I'm experienced in both project management and recruiting and onboarding new consultants in virtual teams using agile approaches.
* I've worked on two open-source projects (MeshMonk and MONK3D)
* I know my way around business development, product management, project management, recruiting, organizational structures, marketing etcetera. All fields required to build both service- and product-oriented businesses from scratch.

#### MIRC -- Medical Imaging Research Center (Leuven, Belgium)

**Research** position, 2012-2014 (24 months):

* I worked for two years as a researcher for the KU Leuven at the medical imaging research center which is located in the university hospital UZ Leuven. My focus was the *development of medical image processing algorithms* for automated diagnosis and quantification of structural pathologies in patients.
* Achievement: Developed an efficient modular surface registration framework capable of processing large surfaces (> 100,000 points) in an efficient way (< 200 seconds).
* Achievement: Developed a method for patient-specific maxillofacial prosthesis design.
* Achievement: Developed a tool for processing and analyzing 3D surface scans (including shape and texture).

#### Rebus vzw (Leuven, Belgium)

**Tutor**, 2009-2010 (4 months)

* My summer jobs in between the academic years as a university student consisted of tutoring. The subjects listed were all at the university level:
 * Mathematical Analysis
 * (Applied) Statistics
 * Electronics and Information Technology
 * Mechanics

#### MTEC -- National Metal and Materials Technology Center (Bangkok, Thailand)

**Internship**, 2011 (two months)

* One of my most life-changing experiences was my two-month internship at the MTEC in Thailand. A first part was spent in the Sangklanagarind hospital of southern Thailand to identify their needs, the second part in the MTEC center near Bangkok to find a solution.
* Achievement: Developed a tool to model patient femurs used for implant design.

## Education
**Master of Science in Electrical Engineering**, 2010-2012

* KU Leuven (Leuven)
* Erasmus Programme at Politecnico di Milano (Milan, Italy)
* Graduated With Honor

**Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering**, 2007-2010

* KU Leuven (Leuven)
* Including a minor in Management

## Hobbies
A big part of my free time is spent in sports:

* Powerlifting
* Basketball
* Sports climbing

Besides sports, I am passionate about travelling, seeing different places and learning about other cultures. I'm always looking for experiences to help me achieve personal growth.
