## True Ambition

I aim to tackle significant challenges like climate change and inequality by building startups focused on data apps. With a solid foundation in programming, data science, marketing, and startup building, I am now enhancing my Python Web Development skills. Driven by a passion for learning, I seek opportunities that will enable me to develop tools that prioritize societal impact over profit.

## Current Learning Adventure
I'm going all in on python web development, and here is where I've gotten so far:

- Diving deeper into Django for the back-end, enjoying things like:
	- AJAX with `htmx` and `django-template-partials` for cleaner templates.
	- Complex queries with Django's `Q`
	- Real-time search
	- Advanced form handling with e.g. formset factories
	- User authentication with `django-allauth`
	- Email verification and notifications
	- ...
- On the front-end, I've designed with Figma and Webflow, and make pages interactive using HTMX, Hyperscript, and some vanilla JS.
- Deployed on Digital Ocean and Render.com with Cloudinary for media management.
- Documenting my learnings along the way with obsidian.md
- Sketching out a roadmap to pinpoint what I want to learn next, ensuring I keep pushing my skills forward.

## Proven Skills
**Performance Marketing**

- **Facebook Ads**: Skilled in creative optimization, ads account management, media buying, and retargeting.
- **Google Ads**: Basic campaign management skills.

**SEO**
- keyword research with AHrefs, content planning and briefing, technical SEO implementations.

**Technical Marketing**
- Developing ELT data pipelines and dashboards for marketing analytics with tools like BigQuery, Dataform, Looker Studio etc
- Server-side tracking with Google Tag Manager.
- Google Analytics 4 for detailed performance analysis.
- Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) for marketing attribution
- CRO with Convert.com, Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity

**Marketing Automation**
- Implementation of affiliate and referral marketing solutions
- Automated email flows with Klaviyo and ActiveCampaign
- Automated popups and user surveys

**Startup Operations**
- **Finance**: Planning, budgeting and cashflow management
- **Governance**: Experienced with implementing Holacracy.
- **Sales and Negotiations**: Effective in closing deals and negotiating terms.
- **Project Management**: Uses Asana and the GTD methodology for project efficiency.

**Data Science**
- Uses sci-kit learn, numpy, and pandas for data analysis and modeling.
- Applies Bayesian inference for statistical modeling with PyMC.
- Builds and analyzes Bayesian MMM's.

**Programming**
- Proficient in Python, C++, and SQL for backend development and data manipulation.

## Achievements
Mini-portfolio pages for each of these achievements will follow:
#### Humainly Project
Employed 30'ish people across Venezuela and Nigeria with collaborations with local NGO's to provide those employees with infrastructure and training so they could build out their careers.
#### Meshmonk
A medical image processing framework developed in C++ for computational efficiency, this framework is used by dozens of researchers mostly working on medical craniofacial data. Below you can see an animation of what it does (transform one surface into another). There are 148 results on scholar.google.com of articles that have used or mentioned MeshMonk ([link](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=meshmonk&btnG=)).

#### Paid Ads Optimization Framework
Developed an advanced paid ads optimization framework, which I'll publish later for others to take inspiration from. This was a big contribution in turning around the sales numbers at the startup I was working at during the energy crisis of Q4 2022. 
#### Marketing Data ELT Pipeline
Without any prior experience with databases and/or SQL, I developed an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipeline for all the marketing data an moonbird. This contributed to our organization being as data-driven as it was. Tools I used were mostly Stitch Data, Dataform and Looker Studio.
#### Server-Side Web Tracking
Web & Server GTM

Drawn to the technical aspect of marketing, I figured I wanted to learn how user tracking works. So autodidactically I figured out how to set up a state-of-the-art tracking system including server-side tagging with Server Google Tag Manager (GTM).
## Experience

### Professional 

#### Moonbird (Belgium)
Growth Engineer, Oct 2020 - May 2024

--- The What ---  
I'm a technically creative numbers guy.  
  
I design and implement experiments to grow moonbird's B2C traction, and let the data teach us what we should do next.  
  
With my engineering and startup entrepreneurship background, I'm proactive, analytical and methodical, and take the fluff out of Growth Hacking to make it uncool but effective.  
  
--- The Why ---  
As someone who knows insomnia first-hand and tried everything, I know moonbird can help people achieve their desired state of mind.  
  
There is a way. But don't take my word for it.  
  
I'll do what I can to find everyone that needed help like I did, and offer them a real solution.  
  
No more dubious fixes that are - at best - ineffective and make people lose hope.---
#### Humainly (Belgium - Venezuela - Nigeria)
Co-Founder & CEO, May 2018 - March 2020

I traveled to South America for 1 year. I ended up in Venezuela and felt I could help people there by creating a digital bridge, creating online work for locals. That idea evolved into my startup Humainly ([https://humainly.com/](https://humainly.com/)), where I was co-founder and CEO. We’d sell digital image labelling services to companies in Belgium. This would create digital jobs that we’d offer to people with little opportunity in Nigeria. Simultaneously, we worked together with Nigerian NGO’s to offer education to those workers. That way they’d have an income while acquiring new skills that could get them on a sustainable career path (outside of our non-profit startup).

Launched Humainly after providing image annotation to clients of our consulting business WebMonks. Humainly combines the best of both worlds in image annotation:  
- Fully dedicated service to clients to help them obtain training data effortlessly  
- Impact sourcing talented people in low-income areas of the world to generate social impact in local communities.
