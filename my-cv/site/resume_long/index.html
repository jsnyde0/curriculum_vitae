<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>
<p>Mini-portfolio pages for each of these achievements will follow:</p>
<h4 id="humainly-project">Humainly Project</h4>
<p>Employed 30'ish people across Venezuela and Nigeria with collaborations with local NGO's to provide those employees with infrastructure and training so they could build out their careers.</p>
<h4 id="meshmonk">Meshmonk</h4>
<p>A medical image processing framework developed in C++ for computational efficiency, this framework is used by dozens of researchers mostly working on medical craniofacial data. Below you can see an animation of what it does (transform one surface into another). There are 148 results on scholar.google.com of articles that have used or mentioned MeshMonk (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=meshmonk&amp;btnG=">link</a>).</p>
<p><em>Insert GIF here</em></p>
<h4 id="paid-ads-optimization-framework">Paid Ads Optimization Framework</h4>
<p>Developed an advanced paid ads optimization framework, which I'll publish later for others to take inspiration from. This was a big contribution in turning around the sales numbers at the startup I was working at during the energy crisis of Q4 2022. </p>
<h4 id="marketing-data-elt-pipeline">Marketing Data ELT Pipeline</h4>
<p>Without any prior experience with databases and/or SQL, I developed an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipeline for all the marketing data an moonbird. This contributed to our organization being as data-driven as it was. Tools I used were mostly Stitch Data, Dataform and Looker Studio.</p>
<h4 id="server-side-web-tracking">Server-Side Web Tracking</h4>
<p>Web &amp; Server GTM</p>
<p>Drawn to the technical aspect of marketing, I figured I wanted to learn how user tracking works. So autodidactically I figured out how to set up a state-of-the-art tracking system including server-side tagging with Server Google Tag Manager (GTM).</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<h3 id="professional">Professional</h3>
<h4 id="moonbird-belgium">Moonbird (Belgium)</h4>
<p>Growth Engineer, Oct 2020 - May 2024</p>
<p>--- The What ---<br />
I'm a technically creative numbers guy.  </p>
<p>I design and implement experiments to grow moonbird's B2C traction, and let the data teach us what we should do next.  </p>
<p>With my engineering and startup entrepreneurship background, I'm proactive, analytical and methodical, and take the fluff out of Growth Hacking to make it uncool but effective.  </p>
<p>--- The Why ---<br />
As someone who knows insomnia first-hand and tried everything, I know moonbird can help people achieve their desired state of mind.  </p>
<p>There is a way. But don't take my word for it.  </p>
<p>I'll do what I can to find everyone that needed help like I did, and offer them a real solution.  </p>
<p>No more dubious fixes that are - at best - ineffective and make people lose hope.---</p>
<h4 id="humainly-belgium-venezuela-nigeria">Humainly (Belgium - Venezuela - Nigeria)</h4>
<p>Co-Founder &amp; CEO, May 2018 - March 2020</p>
<p>I traveled to South America for 1 year. I ended up in Venezuela and felt I could help people there by creating a digital bridge, creating online work for locals. That idea evolved into my startup Humainly (<a href="https://humainly.com/">https://humainly.com/</a>), where I was co-founder and CEO. We’d sell digital image labelling services to companies in Belgium. This would create digital jobs that we’d offer to people with little opportunity in Nigeria. Simultaneously, we worked together with Nigerian NGO’s to offer education to those workers. That way they’d have an income while acquiring new skills that could get them on a sustainable career path (outside of our non-profit startup).</p>
<p>Launched Humainly after providing image annotation to clients of our consulting business WebMonks. Humainly combines the best of both worlds in image annotation:<br />
- Fully dedicated service to clients to help them obtain training data effortlessly<br />
- Impact sourcing talented people in low-income areas of the world to generate social impact in local communities.</p>
